To Do:
    0.) remove the ability to use filters on hardcoded strings, only allow useage of filters on variables. Why would you need a filter on a hardcoded string anyway?
        - change the tests for filters, make them come after tests for template variables
        - make the validation regexes anticipate filters
        - make the proper things template variables instead of fe's.
    1.) get/validate args using regexes (see paragraph at bottom)
    2.) add validation on the number or args passed into macro_block via extended syntax, the name of the arguments, not repeating named arguments, and not having text outside of block tags.
    3.) add more validation to args in general
    4.) write tests for exceptions in macros.py
    5.) check out if we can take advantage of django's built in inclusion tags/include tag to make the code more elegant/robust.
    6.) package it up with distutils and upload the package to pip.
    
    could think about adding more in-depth regex validation on kwarg_regex, which doesn't currently check at all the section it passes to create a template variable.
