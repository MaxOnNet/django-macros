need to finish extended syntax macros.

should really use regexes/match to parse between arguments and keyword arguments, etc..., since the current method will throw a but if the person inputs an argument with an equals sign, like "asdf=asdf". Also, regexes could provide validation. Since comparing against these regexes could be expensive, it might be better to create the kw argument dictionaries in the do_blocks and then pass the pre-made dictionaries to the tags, rather than having the tags figure it out. Also, there's no support for template variables. Should add that as well.

write some tests for the package.

package it up with distutils and upload the package to pip.

get rid of the m = ..., raise template.... pattern. It needlessly sets a variable which is just a wasted computation.

add more validation to the package, testing the variables passed by users into templates.
