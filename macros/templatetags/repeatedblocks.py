# the following file was written/built by Nicholas Lourie,
# while working for kozbox, llc. http://kozbox.com

"""
Installation:

    See readme in root directory, or visit the git at
    https://github.com/nalourie/django-macros


Useage:

    At the beginning of your file include:
        {% load repeatedblocks %}
        
    When you have a block that you want to repeat, instead of
    using a block tag, use a repeated block:

        {% repeatedblock some_block name %}
            ...
            ...
            ...
        {% endblock %}

    Later, when you want to repeat that block again, simply
    include the repeat tag:

        {% repeat some_block name %}


    Thus, the following template:

        {% repeatedblock title %}Repeated Block Tags{% endblock %}

        {% repeat title %}

    Renders to:

        Repeated Block Tags

        Repeated Block Tags

    Make sure that the {% repeat ... %} tag comes after the
    {% repeatedblock ... %} ... {% endblock %} tag.

    They are fully inheritable, repeat inherited content and
    should work exactly as you'd expect a block tag to work.
"""

"""
Design Explanation:

Using a "repeatedblock" followed by "repeat" tag
structure, as opposed to just repeating normal block tags
forces developers to be more explicit about what is repeated.
Thus, it guards against the potential to remove block
tags later in development, not realize they are repeated,
and create an error later. Hence, we've chosen this design since 
it's more advantageous/pythonic in being explicit as well as dry.
